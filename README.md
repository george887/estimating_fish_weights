![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62911364/101485182-6881b600-3920-11eb-8134-eca13f44da32.png)

## Background
Create a machine learning algorithm to accurately estimate the weight of different fish species given multiple measurements. 

## Goals
- Explore the [Fish.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/akdagmelih/multiplelinear-regression-fish-weight-estimation/data) found on kaggle. 
- Follow the appropriate steps of the data science pipeline and deliver a 5 minute [presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEPkmj_Jw8/lNjX0dpNmLdqQPXLfd7SEA/view?utm_content=DAEPkmj_Jw8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink), a github repository, [project_walkthru.ipynb](https://github.com/george887/estimating_fish_weights/blob/master/project_walkthru.ipynb) notebook and [README.md](https://github.com/george887/estimating_fish_weights/blob/master/README.md).
- Create all the necessary files in analysis.
